# PhonePe_Pulse

The goal of this project is to extract data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository, transform and clean the data, 
insert it into a MySQL database, and create a live geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python. 
The dashboard will display the data in an interactive and visually appealing manner, with at least 10 different 
dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display. The solution must be secure, efficient, 
and user-friendly, providing valuable insights and information about the data in the Phonepe pulse Github repository.

# Data extraction: 
Clone the GitHub using scripting to fetch the data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and store it in a suitable format such as CSV or JSON.

# Data transformation: 
Use a scripting language such as Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data. 
This may include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.

# Database insertion: 
Use the "PostgreSQL-connector-python" library in Python to connect to a PostgreSQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL commands.

# Dashboard creation: 
Use the Streamlight and Plotly libraries in Python to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. 
Plotly's built-in geo map functions can be used to display the data on a map and Streamlit can be used to create
a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.

# Data retrieval:
Use the "PostgreSQL-connector-python" library to connect to the postgreSQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas data frame.
Use the data in the data frame to update the dashboard dynamically.

# Deployment: 
Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. 
Test the solution thoroughly and deploy the dashboard publicly, making it accessible to users. 
This approach leverages the power of Python and its numerous libraries to extract, transform,
and analyze data, and create a user-friendly dashboard for visualizing the insights obtained from the data.
